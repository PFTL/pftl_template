# PFTL Template

Template used for [Python for the Lab](https://www.pythonforthelab.com). 

At its core is a template built with TailwindCSS, with a bit of Javascript provided by AlpineJS. 

The first version of the template exists on [The website repository](https://github.com/PFTL/django_website), but I wanted to translate it to Tailwind not just to learn, but also to have the flexibility to expand it according to my needs.
